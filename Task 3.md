# RISC-V INSTRUCTION TYPES
## The RISC-V has various types of instruction formats which we can be grouped in two types : 
#### BASE INSTRUCTION FORMATS :
In the base RV32I ISA , there are four main instruction formats mainly the R-Type , I - type , S - type and U - type .
All are 32 bits long.The base ISA has IALIGN=32, meaning that instructions must be aligned on a four-byte boundary in memory.
If there is an misalignment an exception is taken such it branches or there will occur an unconditional jump , techincally *instruction-address-misaligned exception*.

**As in the image there are source resistors termed as **rs** *(These are the registers that hold the input values for a particular operation or instruction)*.  and destination resisters **rd** *(This register holds the result of the operation performed by the instruction.)* . The **funct3** is a 3-bit field *(field refers to a specific segment or portion of an instruction that contains particular information necessary for the processor to execute that instruction)*  and **funct7** a 7-bit field  and opcode *(an instruction that specifies the operation to be done by the processor)* and imm[x:y] means that the immediate value *(a constant data value embedded directly within an instruction)* is derived from the bits in the instruction ranging from position y to position x.
The RISC-V ISA keeps the source (rs1 and rs2) and destination (rd) registers at the same position in all
formats to simplify decoding.**

####  Immediate Encoding Variants 
There are a further two variants of the instruction formats   based on the handling of immediates namely B-Type and J-Type

### **R-TYPE** : 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e7a9d07-6329-4bef-921f-fb0dae0cbe1f)


the R-Type is an instruction format in the RISC-V architecture to perform arithmetic and logical operations using registers.
As from above

opcode(6-0)  identifies the operation to be performed (add,subtract,etc) ,

rd(11-7) is the destination register  where the result is stored ,

funct3(14-12) specifies the operation within the opcode category ,

rs1(19-15) indicates the first source register that contains one of the operands for the operation ,

rs2(24-20) indicates the 2nd source register that contains the other operand for the operation ,

funct7(31-25) provides the operation, aloowing for more variations of instructions that share the same opcode and funct3 values.



### **I-Type** :

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e4042df-ee63-4428-b8ba-95d41067dc30)

the  I-Type instruction format in the RISC-V architecture is designed for operations that involve immediate values and registers. 

opcode(6-0)  identifies the operation to be performed (load,add immediate) ,

rd(11-7) is the destination register  where the result is stored ,

funct3(14-12) specifies the operation within the opcode category ,

rs1(19-15) indicates the first source register that contains one of the operands for the operation ,

imm[11:0] (31:20) is a 12 bit immediate value which is a constant directly embedded in the instruction.

### **S-Type** :

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a634506-04d6-48f3-a015-90e53db5c9fd)

the S-Type instruction format in the RISC-V architecture is specifically designed for store operations, which involve writing data from registers to memory.

opcode(6-0) identifies the operation to be performed (SW - for store word) ,

imm[4:0] (11-7) these 5 bits of the immediate value specifies an offset *(an offset is an adjustment made to an address)* to be added to the address in rs1 ,

funct3(14-12) specifies the type of storage operation ,

rs1(19-15) first source register that contains the base address where data will be stored ,

rs2(24-20) 2nd source register that contains the data to be stored in memory ,

imm[11:5] (31:25) 7 bits of upper immediate value which complete 12 bit immediate value used as an offset ,


### **U-Type** :

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/063ad859-81ec-4f4a-a303-f0f555936882)

the U-Type instruction format in the RISC-V architecture is designed for operations that involve a 20-bit immediate value, primarily used for loading upper immediate values into registers. 

opcode(6-0) identifies the operation to be performed (LUI - for loading an upper immediate value) ,

rd(11-7) destination register where the result of the operation will be stored ,

imm[31:12] (31:12) 20 bit immediate value which is loaded into the upper part of the destination structure


### **B-Type** :

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ca54226-95ae-4225-aed6-a7bbc2363a82)

the B-Type instruction format in the RISC-V architecture is primarily used for branch instructions, which control the flow of a program based on certain conditions.

opcode(6-0) identifies the operation to be performed (BEQ - equals to , BNE - not equal to) ,

funct3(14-12) specifies the type of branch operation ,

rs1(19-15) is a first source register that contains one of the oprands for the comparision ,

rs2(24-20) the 2nd register that contains the operand for the comparision ,

imm[4:1] (11:7) the lower bits of the immediate value used as part of the offset ,

imm[10:5] (30:25) the middle bits of the immediate value which are also part of the offset for branching ,

imm(1 bit) sign bit of the immediate value, which is used to complete the 13-bit immediate offset for branching .


### **J-Type** :

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/143c16f6-d955-4954-b870-ba0ef1616d87)

the J-Type instruction format in the RISC-V architecture is specifically used for jump instructions, which allow for unconditionally transferring control to a new instruction address.

opcode(6-0) identifies the operation to be performed (JAL - jump and link) ,

rd(11-7) destination register where the return address will be stored ,

imm[19:12] (31:12) middle bits of the immediate value which are part of the target address to jump to ,

imm(1 bit) sign bit of the immediate value,which helps in determining the direction of the jump ,

imm[10:1] (30:21) lower bits of the immediate value which are also part of the target address for jumping ,

imm(1 bit) this bit is included to help with sign extension when calculating the jump address .
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
# Identifying atleast 15 of these instructions in a typical code

The C code is : 

          #include <stdio.h>

          int main() {
              int x = 5; // Number to compute the factorial
              int i;
              int factorial = 1; // Initialize factorial to 1
          
              for(i = 1; i <= x; i++) {
                  factorial *= i; // Multiply factorial by i in each iteration
              }
          
              printf("Factorial of %d is %d\n", x, factorial);
              return 0;
          }

Now we take the obj-dump of this code which is : 

![Screenshot 2024-12-27 141314](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cb613ca-5116-44bd-ae6a-181309f1ebc1)

We will start to nalayze unique instructions ,

### 1)The first instruction

           10184: ff010113 addi sp, sp, -16

the number 10184 represents the address 


the opperation **addi** adds an immediate value to a register ,

**sp** is the stack pointer register (stack pointer is a special-purpose register that holds the memory address of the top of the stack)

and -16 indicates the immidiate value to add to the current value 

Thus we can conclude this is an I-Type instruction


These are  assembly language neumonics where the hexamdecimal instruction is given by **ff010113** which when conveted to binary is as follows :

Hex: `f f 0 1 0 1 1 3`

Binary: `1111 1111 0000 0001 0000 0001 0001 0011`

Code : `-16=111111110000, rs1=00010 ,funct3=000 ,rd=00010 ,opcode=0010011`


### 2)Now we move on to next instruction 

       10188: 00113423     sd     ra,8(sp) 

here the address is 10188 , 

**sd** is the store double which as the name suggests stores a double,

**ra** is the source register which contains the value to be stored ,
  
**8(sp)** indicates the offset of 8 to be  added to the surrent value in stack pointer register

Thus, we can conlude it is an s type of instruction 

These are  assembly language neumonics where the hexamdecimal instruction is given by **00113423** which when conveted to binary is as follows :

Hex: `0 0 1 1 3 4 2 3`

### 3) The next instruction is 

            1018c: 03c00793 li a5,60
here the address is 1018c ,

**li** is a pseudo-instruction *(A pseudo-instruction is an assembly language command that does not correspond directly to a machine instruction. Instead, it simplifies programming by translating into one or more actual machine instructions during assembly.)* to load a constant value directly into a register

**a5** is a destination register where the immediate value is loaded

**60** is the immediate value

Thus we can conclude it is I-Type as the instruction involve one register as destination and one immediate value

These are  assembly language neumonics where the hexamdecimal instruction is given by **03c00793** which when conveted to binary is as follows :

Hex: `0 3 c 0 0 7 9 3`

            10190: fff7879b addiw a5,a5,-1  

here the address is 10190 ,

**addiw** indicates add immediate word,which adds a sign-extended 12-bit immediate to a 32-bit register

**a5** is both the source and destination register

**-1** is the immediate value to be added to the contents of register of  a5

Thus, it is a I-type instruction

These are  assembly language neumonics where the hexamdecimal instruction is given by **03c00793** which when conveted to binary is as follows :

Hex: `f f f 7 8 7 9 b`  

Binary: `1111 1111 1111 0111 1000 0111 1001 1011`

### 5) The next instruction is 

             10194: fe079ee3 bnez a5,10190 <main+0xc>

here the address is 10194 ,

**bnez** stands for branch not equal to zero which checks if the value in register a5 is non zero

if not equal to 0 it branches out to the address 10190 

**<main+0xc>** specifies an address that is 12 bytes beyond the start of the main function.

Thus , it is a B-type

Hex: `f e 0 7 9 e e 3`  

Binary: `1111 1110 0000 0111 1001 1110 1110 0011`

### 6) The next unique instruction is 

             101a0: 00021537 lui a0,0x21

**lui** is used to load 20 bit immediate value into the upper 20 bits of a0 register 

**0x21** is the value which will be loaded 

Thus, its an U-type  instruction 

Hex: `0 0 0 2 1 5 3 7`  

Binary: `0000 0000 0000 0010 0001 0101 0011 0111`

Code : `imm = 0000 0000 0000 0010 0001 , rd = 01010  ,Opcode = 0110111 ` 

### 7) The next unique instruction is

![Screenshot 2025-01-02 151224](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/691bcef8-01d2-43a3-bbe7-359cd13ee172)

### 13) The unique code in this is 

          100e4: ffff0797  auipc a5,0xffff0

The address is 100e4 
**auipc** is used to generate a PC(program counter) - relative address by adding 20-bit immediate value to the upper 20 bits of program couter 

**a5** is the register where the result is stored

**0xffff0** is the immediate value

This is an U-Type of instruction .
