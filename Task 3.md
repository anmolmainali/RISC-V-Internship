# RISC-V INSTRUCTION TYPES
## RISC-V features a variety of instruction formats, which can be broadly classified into two categories:

Base Instruction Formats:
The base RV32I ISA defines four primary instruction formats: R-Type, I-Type, S-Type, and U-Type. Each of these instructions is 32 bits in length. The base ISA specifies IALIGN = 32, requiring instructions to be aligned to a four-byte boundary in memory. If an instruction is misaligned, an exception is triggered. This can result in a branch or an unconditional jump, formally referred to as an instruction-address-misaligned exception.

### In the RISC-V architecture, there are source registers (rs) and destination registers (rd):

* Source registers (rs): These registers hold the input values required for a specific operation or instruction.
* Destination register (rd): This register stores the result of the operation performed by the instruction.

### Other key components include:

* funct3: A 3-bit field that refers to a specific portion of an instruction containing essential information for the processor to execute it.
* funct7: A 7-bit field used similarly to funct3, often providing additional operation-specific details.
* opcode: An instruction field that specifies the operation to be performed by the processor.
* imm[x:y]: Represents an immediate value (a constant embedded directly within an instruction), derived from the bits in the instruction ranging from position y to position x.
* 
### The RISC-V ISA simplifies instruction decoding by maintaining the positions of source registers (rs1 and rs2) and the destination register (rd) consistent across all instruction formats.


# Immediate Encoding Variants
 In RISC-V, there are two additional instruction format variants specifically designed for handling immediate values: B-Type and J-Type.

### **R-TYPE** :

### The R-Type instruction format in the RISC-V architecture is used for arithmetic and logical operations involving registers.

* opcode (bits 6-0): Specifies the operation to be performed (e.g., addition, subtraction).
* rd (bits 11-7): Destination register to store the result of the operation.
* funct3 (bits 14-12): Determines the operation type within the opcode category.
* rs1 (bits 19-15): First source register containing one operand for the operation.
* rs2 (bits 24-20): Second source register containing the other operand.
* funct7 (bits 31-25): Provides additional encoding, allowing variations of instructions with the same opcode and funct3 values.




### **I-Type** :

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e4042df-ee63-4428-b8ba-95d41067dc30)

### I-Type
The I-Type instruction format is designed for operations involving immediate values and registers.

* opcode (bits 6-0): Specifies the operation to be performed (e.g., load, add immediate).
* rd (bits 11-7): Destination register to store the result.
* funct3 (bits 14-12): Determines the operation type within the opcode category.
* rs1 (bits 19-15): First source register containing an operand.
* imm[11:0] (bits 31-20): A 12-bit immediate value embedded directly within the instruction.

### **S-Type** :

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a634506-04d6-48f3-a015-90e53db5c9fd)

The S-Type instruction format is used for store operations, which transfer data from registers to memory.

* opcode (bits 6-0): Specifies the operation to be performed (e.g., SW - store word).
* imm[4:0] (bits 11-7): Lower 5 bits of the immediate value, representing an offset to be added to the base address in rs1.
* funct3 (bits 14-12): Determines the type of storage operation.
* rs1 (bits 19-15): Source register containing the base address.
* rs2 (bits 24-20): Source register containing the data to be stored in memory.
* imm[11:5] (bits 31-25): Upper 7 bits of the immediate value, completing the 12-bit offset.


### **U-Type** :

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/063ad859-81ec-4f4a-a303-f0f555936882)

The U-Type instruction format is designed for operations involving a 20-bit immediate value, such as loading upper immediate values into registers.

* opcode (bits 6-0): Specifies the operation (e.g., LUI - load upper immediate).
* rd (bits 11-7): Destination register to store the result.
* imm[31:12] (bits 31-12): A 20-bit immediate value loaded into the upper portion of the destination register.


### **B-Type** :

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ca54226-95ae-4225-aed6-a7bbc2363a82)

The B-Type instruction format is used for branch instructions, which control program flow based on conditions.

* opcode (bits 6-0): Specifies the operation (e.g., BEQ - branch if equal, BNE - branch if not equal).
* funct3 (bits 14-12): Determines the type of branch operation.
* rs1 (bits 19-15): First source register containing one operand for comparison.
* rs2 (bits 24-20): Second source register containing the other operand for comparison.
* imm[4:1] (bits 11-7): Lower bits of the immediate value, part of the branch offset.
* imm[10:5] (bits 30-25): Middle bits of the immediate value, completing the offset.
* imm[11] (1 bit): Sign bit of the immediate value, used to determine the direction of the branch.

### **J-Type** :

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/143c16f6-d955-4954-b870-ba0ef1616d87)

The J-Type instruction format is used for jump instructions, which unconditionally transfer control to a new instruction address.

* opcode (bits 6-0): Specifies the operation (e.g., JAL - jump and link).
* rd (bits 11-7): Destination register to store the return address.
* imm[19:12] (bits 31-12): Middle bits of the immediate value, part of the target jump address.
* imm[11] (1 bit): Sign bit of the immediate value, indicating the jump's direction.
* imm[10:1] (bits 30-21): Lower bits of the immediate value, part of the target address.
* imm[20] (1 bit): Bit used for sign extension when calculating the jump address.

# Identifying atleast 15 of these instructions in a typical code

The C code is : 

          #include <stdio.h>

          int main() {
              int x = 5; // Number to compute the factorial
              int i;
              int factorial = 1; // Initialize factorial to 1
          
              for(i = 1; i <= x; i++) {
                  factorial *= i; // Multiply factorial by i in each iteration
              }
          
              printf("Factorial of %d is %d\n", x, factorial);
              return 0;
          }

Now we take the obj-dump of this code which is : 

![Screenshot 2024-12-27 141314](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cb613ca-5116-44bd-ae6a-181309f1ebc1)

We will start to analyze unique instructions ,

### 1)The first instruction

           10184: ff010113 addi sp, sp, -16

the number 10184 represents the address 


the opperation **addi** adds an immediate value to a register ,

**sp** is the stack pointer register (stack pointer is a special-purpose register that holds the memory address of the top of the stack)

and -16 indicates the immidiate value to add to the current value 

Thus we can conclude this is an I-Type instruction

# Instruction Analysis in RISC-V Assembly

**sd** is the store double which as the name suggests stores a double,

**ra** is the source register which contains the value to be stored ,
  
**8(sp)** indicates the offset of 8 to be  added to the surrent value in stack pointer register

Thus, we can conlude it is an s type of instruction

### 3) The next instruction is 

            1018c: 03c00793 li a5,60
here the address is 1018c ,

**li** is a pseudo-instruction *(A pseudo-instruction is an assembly language command that does not correspond directly to a machine instruction. Instead, it simplifies programming by translating into one or more actual machine instructions during assembly.)* to load a constant value directly into a register

**a5** is a destination register where the immediate value is loaded

**60** is the immediate value

Thus we can conclude it is I-Type as the instruction involve one register as destination and one immediate value

These are  assembly language neumonics where the hexamdecimal instruction is given by **03c00793** which when conveted to binary is as follows :

Hex: `0 3 c 0 0 7 9 3`

**a5** is both the source and destination register

**-1** is the immediate value to be added to the contents of register of  a5

Thus, it is a I-type instruction

here the address is 10194 ,

**bnez** stands for branch not equal to zero which checks if the value in register a5 is non zero

if not equal to 0 it branches out to the address 10190 

**<main+0xc>** specifies an address that is 12 bytes beyond the start of the main function.

Thus , it is a B-type

Hex: `f e 0 7 9 e e 3`  

Binary: `1111 1110 0000 0111 1001 1110 1110 0011`
